# Apache-Hadoop_MapReduce_WordCount
Apache Hadoop is an open source software framework for storage and large scale processing of data-sets on clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop is an Apache top-level project being built and used by a global community of contributors and users.Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2005. It was originally developed to support distribution for the Nutch search engine project. Doug, who was working at Yahoo! at the time and is now Chief Architect of Cloudera, named the project after his son's toy elephant. Cutting's son was 2 years old at the time and just beginning to talk. He called his beloved stuffed yellow elephant "Hadoop".

This assignment focuses on how to use Apache Hadoop MapReduce on Word Count Application. Here we give a .txt file as an input to the mapreduce program and get the output of &lt;key, value> pairs of frequencies for each word preset in the text file.
